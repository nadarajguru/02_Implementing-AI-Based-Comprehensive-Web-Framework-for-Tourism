The focus of this research is to create an AI-based tour recommender system. The recommendation framework is a web-based system that may deliver a customized rundown of vacation sites, eateries, and accommodations relying upon the traveler’s inclinations. Conventional recommendation techniques like content-based filtering and synergistic sifting are known to be advantageous in the tourism industry. Moreo-ver, in light of the information gained from user’s interests and inclinations, recom-mendations are made utilizing content-based suggestions. Data dependent on com-parable profiles is suggested when the client utilizes the service more using communi-ty-oriented recommendation. Furthermore, a design of a chat bot is provided which gives a genuine and precise response for any question using Artificial Intelligence, which permits individuals to textually communicate with the objective of organizing visits and requesting fascinating spots worth visiting. The Flask development frame-work is utilized to construct the system, since it accentuates rapid development and simple, pragmatic design. 
The system methodology is discussed comprehensively with the aim of explaining the functionalities of the system.
Users can make use of the website's features by checking in to the system after browsing the site. Users who have registered/signed up for the website are the only ones who can log in. New users can sign up for an account on the website and create a username, password, and other credentials, which are then recorded in the system database. After registering, a user may log in to the website using the username and password they used to sign up. The login is successful when the login information match those maintained in the database, and the user continues to the next page. After successfully logging in, the process of locating the optimal attraction location for the user begins with the user providing tour information. This procedure works by taking into account the interests and preferences of the users. The category of tourist attraction site that the tourist chooses to visit, such as interior sites, outdoor activities, architectural heritage sites, environmental regions, and so on, is collected from users. The user must choose between two and three different categories of favorite interests. The Recommendation system uses AI/ML to provide recommendations based on the data (interests and preferences) provided by the user. The recommendation system's two main objectives are to provide users with generic travel plans and lodging options based on their preferences. The user is given a generic plan to which they may apply various filters to design the components of the tour that are most appropriate for them.

Filters by gross tour budget, area of stay, type of lodging, length of stay, hotel type, culinary preferences, and so forth. Following that, the customer may make a hotel reservation after deciding on a budget, length of stay, quality of stay, service, and food preference. It allows users to personalize their plans and is appropriate for peo-ple of all ages and interests. The consumers are given a wide variety of options that may be modified from one individual to the next. By selecting the cuisine that the user likes, the user may pick a restaurant with convenience and speed. Next, consum-ers may narrow down the best restaurants for them by picking a restaurant category, such as fast food, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, Jain, and so on. Users may also pick a financial range to spend at the restaurant, as well as the sort of restaurant they want to visit, such as Fine Dining, Casual Dining, Buffet, Café, Fast Casual, and so on. The processes for booking a hotel room are identical to those for booking a restaurant. To begin, customers can choose their desired budget for lodging. The user then chooses the sort of accommodation they want to stay in, such as Single, Double, Deluxe, Twin, or Suite. The customer must then choose depending on availability, budget, luxury, cleanliness, pool, and laundry facilities, among other factors. Following the customer is given with a one-of-a-kind and tailored trip plan, complete with tourist information, nearby eateries, and an itinerary.
